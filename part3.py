#code starts here
number1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))

print("The sum of your numbers is", number1 + number2) 
print("Seven times your second number is", 7 * number2)

#added () to first print, added "" to the second, fixed multiplication formatting,  added an int to num1, moved a comma outside the quotations for second print, made number2 lowercase in first print, added a ) to number 2-- maybe my own mistake
